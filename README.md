# Simple-Python-Password-Checker

Hello! Thanks for stumbling across my little gateway. This is my first project on GitHub inspired from Max O'Didily from YouTube. 

This simple code checks a password's validity. The validity criterias:
  - Length of 6 - 15 characters.
  - At least one upper case character, one lower case character, one numerical value and one special character.

I will be improving this code more. Feel free to give me any suggestions and any ways to improve my code!
